=== Meraki Dashboard Configuration

. Deploy the vMX Nodes: First we need to generate two vMX nodes inside the Meraki dashboard which we will then instantiate on AWS.  Begin by creating two new Security Appliance network in your organization. This https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Organizations_and_Networks/Creating_and_Deleting_Dashboard_Networks[guide^] will walk you through creating a new network in the Meraki Dashboard.
Once you have created the network and added the appropriate license you will be able to deploy a new vMX instance in your network by navigating to Security & SD-WAN > Appliance Status and clicking on the relevant 'Add VMX' button:on your Meraki dashboard.

For more details, please refer to the *Meraki Dashboard Configuration* section of the https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)#Meraki%20Dashboard%20Configuration[vMX Setup Guide for AWS^]

. Deploy Network Tags: For identifying the appropriate vMXs as primary and seconday hubs, we leverage Network Tags. vMX-1 is is used to identify the primary hub and vMX-2 tag is used to identify the secondary Hub. To set the network tags for the vMXs, navigate to the *Organization > Overview* page and select the checkbox next to the network that you wish to tag. Below is a snippet of the Meraki Dashboard Overview page:

. Branch Site Configuration: Navigate to Security & SD-WAN > Configure > Site-to-Site page on the Meraki Dashboard and configure your branch sites as autovpn spokes with the vMXs as the primary and secondary hubs.

. Generate Authentication Tokens for the vMXs: After you've added the new vMX to your network, navigate to *Security & SD-WAN > Appliance* status and select “*Generate authentication token”* to generate the token. This token would be used as an input parameter for the Quickstart templates.

. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. For details on each parameter, see the link:#_parameter_reference[Parameter reference] section of this guide. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
