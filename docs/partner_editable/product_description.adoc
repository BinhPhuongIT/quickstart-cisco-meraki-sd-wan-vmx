Virtual MX (vMX) is a virtual instance of a Meraki security and
SD-WAN appliance dedicated specifically to providing the simple
configuration benefits of site-to-site Auto VPN for organizations
running or migrating IT services to public or private cloud
environments. An Auto VPN tunnel to a vMX is like having a direct
Ethernet connection to a private data center.

vMX functions like a VPN concentrator and includes SD-WAN functionality like other MX devices. 
For instructions on how the vMX works on AWS, please see the Meraki documentation for https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)[vMX Setup Guide for AWS^]
