Meraki virtual MX (vMX) is a virtualized image of a Meraki MX enterprise security and Cisco SD-WAN appliance, deployable in the cloud. This Quick Start deploys an SD-WAN virtual private cloud (VPC) with two Meraki vMX instances, each in a different availability zone (AZ).

https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/transit-gateway/[Amazon Transit Gateway^] is included in the deployment to extend connectivity to workload resources across different Regions. A https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[VPC attachment] is used to link the SD-WAN VPC and transit gateway. You can use your existing workflows and connect your workload VPCs to the transit gateway. Each vMX instance is configured as a primary or secondary hub to the Meraki branch sites. The instances advertise the subnets available in AWS to https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/Site-to-site_VPN/Meraki_Auto_VPN_-_Configuration_and_Troubleshooting[Meraki Auto VPN]. An Amazon AWS Lambda script monitors the vMX instances. It updates the SD-WAN VPC and transit gateway route tables with the Auto VPN routes containing the appropriate vMX instance.
