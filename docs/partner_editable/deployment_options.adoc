This Quick Start provides two deployment options:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, Internet Gateways, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC along with the lambda function.
