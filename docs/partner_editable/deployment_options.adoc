This Quick Start provides the following deployment option:

* *Deploy {partner-product-short-name} into a new VPC*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the SDWAN VPC, subnets, Internet Gateways, security groups, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys {partner-product-short-name} into this new VPC along with the lambda function.
