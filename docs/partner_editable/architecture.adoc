As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway connecting the VPC to the internet.
* A public route table to specify routing rules for outbound internet traffic.
* In the public subnets, Meraki vMX appliances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, configured as hubs in the Meraki VPN network.
* In the private subnets, elastic network interfaces to enable traffic routing from all subnets in the Availability Zone to Transit Gateway.
* A transit gateway route table associated with the VPC for routing rules to Transit Gateway.
* Transit Gateway attached to the VPC, enabling connectivity to attached workload VPCs in other AWS Regions.
* CloudWatch to invoke AWS Lambda if a Meraki vMX instance fails.
* AWS Lambda to update route tables during failover or failback events.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store a Meraki API key. AWS Lambda uses the API key to access the Meraki dashboard when updating route tables.
