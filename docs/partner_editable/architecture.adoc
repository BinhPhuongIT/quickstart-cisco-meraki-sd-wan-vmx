As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A SDWAN VPC configured with public internet access, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the SD-WAN VPC:
** An internet gateway for public internet access is deployed
** Two vMX appliances are deployed and onboarded to their corresponding Meraki networks
* In addition a Transit Gateway is deployed and the SD-WAN VPC is attached as a VPC attachment to the TGW
* A lambda function is deployed to monitor the state of the vMXs and update the VPC and the TGW route tables to handle failover and failback.
