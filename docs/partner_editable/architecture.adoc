image::../images/cisco-meraki-sd-wan-vmx-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An internet gateway connecting the VPC to the internet.
* A public route table to specify routing rules for inbound internet traffic and a local route for communication within the VPC.
* In the public subnets, Meraki vMX appliances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, configured as hubs in the Meraki VPN network.
* In the private subnets, elastic network interfaces to enable traffic routing from all subnets in the AZ to Transit Gateway. 
* Amazon CloudWatch to invoke AWS Lambda if a Meraki vMX instance fails.
* AWS Lambda to update route tables in the VPC and Transit Gateway after a failover or failback event. 
* Transit Gateway to attach to the VPC and enable connectivity to attached workload VPCs in other AWS Regions. 
* AWS Secrets Manager to store a Meraki API key. AWS Lambda uses the API key to access the Meraki dashboard when updating route tables.
